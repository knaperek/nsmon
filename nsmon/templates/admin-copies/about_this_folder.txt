As it turns out, it seems that it is impossible to override (just override, not completely replace) some admin templates, such as index.html.
It is impossible to override index.html template. When trying, error is raised informing about max. recursion attained - which means, that template is extending from itself.
Used was tag {% extend admin/index.html %}
While this is working with most other templates, like change_list.html, it's not working with index.html template. This template is also not listed in django documentation as can-be-overrided-template, instead, there is stated, that this template should be override by another way (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#templates-which-may-be-overridden-per-app-or-model)

So, this folder is a little workaround. It stores original admin templates (copied from /usr/share/.../django/contrib/admin/templates/admin...). These copies are refered to from other templates, such as custom index.html template. So custom (my own) index.html template does not have to extend from admin/index.html (which would lead to described error instead of proper extending from shared django libs), but it extends from this one.

When migrating to newer versions of django, these copies are expected to be replaced with newer versions (unless it breaks some compatibility).
